## Description

EZ Project is a small application designed to simplify project management exclusive to autodesk maya. The philosophy of this application is to design asset navigation as intuitive as possible, so finding the file is much easier without the needs to fiddle around with complicated folder structure. Currently it's only suppport asset file like maya ASCII (.ma), maya Binary (.mb) and FBX (.fbx) file format. 

## Features
---
- customizable project and asset
- easy asset navigation
including 3 basics asset group (character asset, prop asset, sets asset), search the asset, sort the asset
- submit asset or change asset status
-set deadline of the asset
one of my favourite features about this application, go to the asset by priority, so user can go straight to the assignment that day
- easy process to transfer project data to other user
- (experimental) take a screenshot
- (experimental) automated file version control
