## Description

EZ Project is a small application designed to simplify project management. The philosophy of this application is to create asset navigation as intuitively as possible, so finding the file is much more effective without the need to fiddle around with a complicated folder structure. Currently, it only supports asset files like Maya ASCII (.ma), Maya Binary (.mb), and FBX (.fbx) file formats.

**Author's note:**Â 
I might or might not update this application in the future, even though this application has a lot of potential and it's only the bare-bones functionality that is supported. Maybe if I have time in the future, I will keep adding new useful features. Fingers crossed!Â ðŸ¤ž
